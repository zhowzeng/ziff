# A Comment can only anchor to a line the worktree has

A [[Comment]] is handed to a CLI agent as `path:L12` (ADR 0007), and the agent resolves that against the worktree. So Ziff only offers to anchor a comment where that number means the same thing on both sides. Two things follow.

**The [[Branch]] under review is the checked-out one, not a pick.** Branch-mode's new side is the selected branch's own content, and Ziff never checks anything out (ADR 0003) — so a branch the reviewer isn't on produces line numbers their worktree doesn't have. The topbar's branch control becomes a read-only indicator of what's checked out, and the [[Base Branch]] picker is the only branch the reviewer chooses. `Unstaged` and `Staged` never depended on the choice anyway: they diff the working tree, index and HEAD of whatever is checked out.

**A deleted line can't be commented on.** Its number belongs to the old side, which the worktree no longer has, so `path:L11` would name unrelated content. Unified view now withholds the add-comment affordance on a del line, matching what Split view already did, and `CommentAnchor` drops its `old` side.

One cost is accepted rather than solved: `Staged` mode's new side is the index, not the worktree, so a file with unstaged changes on top has line numbers the worktree doesn't have. That is untouched here and still open. A second cost — Branch mode's new side being the branch tip, which a worktree with uncommitted changes sits slightly off — was accepted here and has since been closed by ADR 0012, which moved that new side to the worktree.

## Considered Options

- **Carry more in the hand-off text** (commit sha, side, or the line's own content, so any anchor can be resolved): rejected — it re-contracts what Ziff hands an agent and undoes ADR 0007's reason for `path:L12` being enough. Worth revisiting if reviewing a branch you're not on ever becomes a real need.
- **Let Ziff check out the branch under review**: rejected — ADR 0003 keeps Ziff read-only over the Repo, and silently moving a reviewer's HEAD is a far bigger promise than a review tool should make.
- **Warn instead of withhold** (keep commenting everywhere, flag the anchors that may not resolve): rejected — the handed-off text would still be wrong, just with a disclaimer attached somewhere the agent never sees.
- **Translate a deleted line to the nearest surviving line**: rejected — the number would resolve, which is worse: it points at content the reviewer didn't select, with nothing to reveal the substitution.
