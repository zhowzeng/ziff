// the time the hand-off happens: another agent, the reviewer's own editor, or the
// agent acting on an earlier hand-off may have moved or rewritten those lines.

// This module is the comparison itself, which is pure logic. Reading the file it
// compares against belongs to Rust (docs/decisions/0005) and happens in handoff.ts.
